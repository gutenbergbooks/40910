<h3>
<span>THE CAXTON COFFER.</span>
</h3>

<p class="center">[<i>Proposals of Mr. Randal Minshull, c. 1742.</i><a id="hull1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>]</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#hull1" class="label">[1]</a> This document, though before printed, is as rare as a
manuscript. Dibdin had not seen it when he wrote his memoir of Caxton,
nor could he prove its existence but by a reference to the <i>Bibliotheca
Westiana</i>. It is now reprinted from a copy in the Grenville collection
in the British Museum. The specimen is a small folio, in pica type, and
on thin laid paper. As my information on Mr. Randal Minshull is at
present very scanty, I reserve it with the hope of more fortunate
gleanings.&mdash;B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span>.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Proposals for printing an exact and ample account of all the books
printed by William Caxton, who was the first printer in England: wherein
will be set forth some select chapters from each book, to shew the
nature and diction thereof, with all his proems, prologues, epilogues,
and tables, in his own words. There will be also interspersed several
ancient and curious matters relating to the history of England, and
other curious subjects: with a vocabulary of the old English words, and
an explanation of them, which will greatly illustrate the ancient
English language, as it was written in the reign of Edward III. and
continued down to Henry VII. kings of England, as contained in the
writings of Thomas Woodstock duke of Glocester, Anthony Woodville earl
Rivers, John Gower, Geoffry Chaucer, John Lydgate, and other famous
persons.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"By R. Minshull, library-keeper to the right honourable the earl of
Oxford deceas'd.</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>'Ut sylvæ foliis pronos mutantur in annos,</p>
      <p>Prima cadunt, ita verborum vetus interit ætas,</p>
      <p>Et juvenum ritu, florent modo nata vigentq;</p>
      <p>Debemur morti nos, nostraq;!'&mdash;H<span class="smcap lowercase">OR</span>.</p>

</div>

  <p class="blockquot">"It is proposed by the editor hereof, as follows: viz.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"I. This work will contain about 200 sheets of paper, printed in the same
form of letter and paper, as this specimen.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"II. There shall be no more printed than 500<a id="Page_266"></a> <span class="pagenum">[266]</span> books, suitable to
the proposed number of subscribers.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"III. That for the more expeditious carrying on, and effecting thereof,
every subscriber shall pay to the editor two guineas; viz. one guinea at
the time of subscribing, and the other guinea upon the delivery of a
perfect book in sheets.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"N.B. Proposals will be delivered, subscriptions taken, and proper
receipts given for the money, by the editor R. Minshull, at Mrs.
Reffers, in Maddox-street, near St. George's church, Hanover-square.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Received this [&nbsp;&nbsp;] day of [&nbsp;&nbsp;] 174[] from [&nbsp;&nbsp;] one guinea, being the first
payment [for] The account of the books printed by William Caxton,
according to the above proposals.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"An exact and ample account of all the books printed by William Caxton,
&amp;c.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"The first work of William Caxton, appears to be (as he calls it) The
recuyell of the historyes of Troye, divided into three parts, the whole
containing 778 pages (as numbred by my self, they not being figured in
the printing) in a short folio, the paper being very thick and strong:
there are no initial capital letters in this book, which shews that he
had not formed any at that time. In his preface to this book he declares
that he was born in the Weeld of Kent, where he first learned the
rudiments of the English tongue; a place wherein he doubts not, is spoke
as broad and rude English, as in any part of England: that he never was
in France, but that he continued the space of thirty years, for the most
part, in Brabant, Flanders, Holland and Zealand.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"He also says, that this history was first translated into French, from
several Latin authors, by a certain worshipful man, named the right
venerable and worthy Raoul le Feure, priest and chaplain to Philip duke
of Burgundy, in 1464; being the fourth year of the reign of king Edward
IV. In which year he was employed by that king in conjunction with
Richard Whetchill, esq.; to treat and conclude certain actions of
commerce between the said king and Philip duke of Burgundy: their
Commission, as set forth in Rymer's <i>F&oelig;dera</i>, is as follows; [See
Rymer.]</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"It was from the said French translation that Mr. Caxton formed this
history, in the prologue of which he stiles himself mercer of the city
of London; and it was by the command of his royal patroness, Margaret,
sister to king Edward IV. after her marriage with Charles, duke of
Burgundy, that he undertook it and finish'd it. A description of this
noble marriage is largely set forth by John Stow and Hollingshead, in
their chronicles; the latter gives the following character and
description of this royal princess, viz. 'She was a lady of excellent
beauty,'" &amp;c. [See Holinshed.]</p>






<h3>
<span>JOHN TRADESCANT THE YOUNGER, AN ENGLISHMAN.</span>
</h3>

<p>Great is the interest attached to the name of Tradescant, and we believe
few articles in our journal have been perused with greater satisfaction
than those by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span> and other valued correspondents, which appeared
in our third volume (pp. 119. 286. 353. 391. 393.), illustrative of
their history. In the same volume (p. 469.) a correspondent, C. C. R.,
after quoting the following mutilated MS. note, written in pencil in a
copy of Dr. Ducarel's Tract on the subject, preserved among the books in
the Ashmolean Museum&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Consult (with certainty of finding information concerning the
   Tradescants) the Registers of&mdash;apham,  Kent,"&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">suggested that Meopham was the parish referred to, and that search
should be made there by some correspondent resident in that
neighbourhood. The hint was not, however, taken, and the matter dropped
for a time.</p>

<p>At the close of last year we received a communication from a learned and
much valued friend, now, alas! no more,<a id="more2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> telling us that Meopham <i>was</i>
the place referred to, and suggesting that we should get extracts from
the register for the information of our readers. Upon this hint we
acted; but our endeavours, for reasons to which we need not more
particularly refer, failed, and it was not until our attention was
recalled to the subject by the endeavour that is making, and we trust
successfully making, to procure subscriptions for restoring the
Tradescant Monument at Lambeth, that we applied to another friend
resident in the neighbourhood of Meopham for his assistance in the
business. That assistance was (as it has ever been) rendered most
cheerfully and most effectually; and we are now enabled to lay before
our readers and the Committee of the Tradescant Monument Restoration
Fund, the following evidence that John Tradescant the younger was a Man
of Kent. It is extracted from the baptismal register of Meopham.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn2"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#more2" class="label">[2]</a> That excellent man and ripe scholar, the Rev. Lancelot
Sharpe, who was one of the first, on the appearance of "N. &amp; Q.," to
convey to us his good opinion of our paper, and to prove it by giving us
his communications. For particulars of his life and literary labours,
the reader is referred to the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for January, 1852,
p. 99.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"1608 August the iiij daye John the sonne of John Tradescant was
   baptised eodem die&mdash;"</p>

<p>Although we are not without hopes of receiving further information from
the same source, we could not refrain from bringing this new fact in the
history of the Tradescants at once before our readers.<a id="Page_267"></a> <span class="pagenum">[267]</span></p>



<h3>
<span>COWLEY AND HIS MONUMENT.</span>
</h3>

<p>If Pope in his time could ask, "Who now reads Cowley?" and if Cowper, at
a later period, could lament that his "splendid wit" should have been
"entangled in the cobwebs of the schools," it may be in our day, when
most good people who cultivate poetry, either as readers or writers,
swear by Wordsworth or Tennyson, that the bare mention of Cowley's name,
in some circles, would be resented as a kind of impertinence. But Pope's
answer to his own question is as apposite now as when the question was
first put. If Cowley&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem">

                <p class="i9">"&mdash;&mdash;pleases yet,</p>
      <p>His <i>moral</i> pleases, not his pointed wit;</p>
      <p>Forgot his epic, nay pindaric art,</p>
      <p>But still I love the language of his <i>heart</i>."</p>

</div>


<p>The <i>Davideis</i> and the <i>Herbs and Plants</i> find few readers beyond those
who resort to them for special purposes; but poets of more recent times,
even whilst contemning his "conceits," have (as your volumes have
frequently shown) often borrowed his ideas without improving upon the
phraseology in which they have been clothed. Witness, for instance,
Cowper's transmutation of his noble line:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "God the first garden made&mdash;the first city, Cain,"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">into his own smooth generality of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "God made the country, and man made the town."</p>

</div>

<p>And Cowley's love of Nature, and his beautiful lyrics in praise of a
country life, will always keep his name before us. However, to desist
from this "nothing-if-not-critical" strain, let me beg of you to lay the
accompanying transcript [<i>see the next page</i>] of a manuscript in my
possession before your readers&mdash;that is, if you deem it of sufficient
interest.</p>

<p>The verses themselves, evidently of a date not long subsequent to the
erection of the Cowley monument in Westminster Abbey, are written on the
back of a damaged copy of Faithorne's engraved portrait of him. They
comprise a not very correct transcript of the Latin inscription on the
monument, a translation and paraphrase of the same, and what is styled a
"burlesque," in which one of the chief features of the monument itself
is ludicrously associated with the profession of Sir Charles
Scarborough, Cowley's friend. The "Per Carolum Scarborough, Militem,
Med. Doctorem," implies, it may be presumed, that Sir Charles was the
author of the Latin epitaph, of which it has always been understood, and
indeed it is so stated in the later biographies of the poet, that
Cowley's close friend and literary executor Sprat, Bishop of Rochester,
was the author. Scarborough published an elegy to Cowley's memory, of
which I am informed there is no copy in the British Museum library; and
being unable to refer to it in any other collection, I have no means of
ascertaining whether this elegy discloses the fact of the authorship of
the epitaph. This is not an unimportant point, since it will be
recollected that Dr. Johnson expends a considerable amount of
indignation upon the epitaph, not on account of its Latinity, but on
account of what he considers as the false sentiments of which it is made
the vehicle.</p>

<p>The value of the manuscript depends of course upon the possibility of
the chief item of its contents being unpublished. Whatever respect the
writer may have entertained towards Cowley, he certainly seems inclined
to be merry at the expense of Sir Charles Scarborough. The unwieldy urn
which surmounts the monument, is variously designated as a "whimwham urn
as broad as sawcer," and as "the surgeon's gally-pot." These are not
very complimentary epithets, it is true; but if they ever met the
courtly physician's eye he could afford to laugh with the laughers.
Cowley's lack of success in his attempt to obtain the mastership of the
Savoy is not forgotten; but the satirist speaks of the dead poet very
goodhumouredly, and may be said to concur in opinion with those of his
admirers who predicted for his writings an enduring immortality. But
"sugar-candy Cowley," as the burlesquer terms him, is now obliged to be
content with a few pages in the <i>Selections from British Poets</i>, where
indeed he is entitled to a very eminent position; whilst "dull Chaucer,"
as he is irreverently called, with whom the writer quietly prays that
Cowley may quietly "sleep in beggar's limbo," seems to live almost
bodily amongst us; and his vivid pictures and naïve descriptions are so
acceptable, that it may safely be predicted that an edition of the
<i>Canterbury Tales</i> will always be a more profitable venture for a
publisher than a speculation in a new edition of the <i>Davideis</i>.</p>

<p>But, after all, Cowley's acceptance amongst those who immediately
survived him, is perhaps due quite as much to the recollection of his
amiable personal qualities, as to his poetic abilities; and when Charles
II., "who never <i>said</i> a foolish thing," declared, on being informed of
the poet's death, that "Mr. Cowley had not left a better <i>man</i> behind
him in England," the merry monarch may have intended exactly what he
said, and no more. With these rambling remarks I leave the matter, only
trusting, if I shall be found to have called attention to what may
possibly be an old acquaintance of some of your learned readers, that my
desire to contribute an occasional mite to the pages of a periodical,
from which I gather so much information, will be accepted as an apology.</p>

<h3>
<span>COUNT KÖNIGSMARK AND THE DUCHESS OF SOMERSET.</span>
</h3>

<p>Several notices of Count Königsmark have lately appeared in "N. &amp; Q.,"
Walpole's mistake having occasioned a question by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M<span class="smcap lowercase">ARKLAND</span>
respecting his identity. There can, however, be no doubt that the person
who was tried for being accessory to the assassination of Mr. Thynne in
1681-2, and whose trial is reported at length in the 9th volume of
Howell's <i>State Trials</i>, p. 1., was Charles John Count Königsmark, as
stated by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">RUCE</span> in Vol. v., p. 115. of "N. &amp; Q.," and whose
biography and genealogy are more fully given by J. R. J. in p. 183. of
the same volume.</p>

<p>In the Note on this subject by J. R. J. it is stated that "the most
mysterious episode in the life of this Count Königsmark was brought on
by his sueing for England's richest and highest heiress, Elizabeth,
daughter of Josceline, second Earl of Northumberland." This is perfectly
true; but the personal history of this lady, her connexion with
Königsmark, her imputed privity to the murder of Mr. Thynne, and the
savage allusion to these circumstances by Swift thirty years afterwards,
deserve a more particular notice.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, Baroness Percy, was daughter and heiress of Josceline, Earl
of Northumberland, who died in 1670. According to Collins (<i>Peerage</i>,
vol. iv. p. 185.) she was four years old at the time of her father's
death; so that she was born in 1666. In 1679 she was married to Henry
Cavendish, Earl of Ogle, who was only son and heir of the Duke of
Newcastle, and who died in 1680, before either party were of puberty to
consummate the marriage. In 1681 the Lady Ogle was married to Thomas
Thynne, of Longleat, in the county of Wilts, Esquire,&mdash;a gentleman of
great wealth, a friend of the Duke of Monmouth, and the Issachar of
Dryden's "Absalom and Achitophel." Sir John Reresby, in his <i>Memoirs</i>,
p. 135., says "The lady, repenting of the match, fled from her husband
into Holland before they were bedded." Whether this elopement had any
relation to Königsmark does not appear: but a few months afterwards,
namely, in February 1681-2, Mr. Thynne was assassinated in the Haymarket
by foreigners, who were devoted friends of the Count, and who apparently
acted under his direction, or, at all events, with his acquiescence. The
Count was at that time a mere youth, and having been in London a few
months before Lady Ogle's marriage with Mr. Thynne, had then paid his
addresses to her. He returned into England about ten days before the
murder, and was in London at the time it was committed. In endeavouring
to escape beyond sea the day afterwards, he was taken in disguise at
Gravesend, brought to Westminster, and examined before King and Council.
Sir John Reresby says, "I was present upon this occasion, and observed
that he appeared before the king with all the assurance imaginable. He
was a fine person of a man, and I think his hair was the longest I ever
saw." He denied all participation in the murder, but he was committed
and tried with the principals, as an accessory before the fact; and
although acquitted by the jury, a perusal of the trial produces a strong
persuasion that he was privy to the purpose of the assassins. A fact
much pressed against him was his inquiry of the Swedish envoy, "Whether
or no, if he should kill Mr. Thynne in a duel, he could, by the laws of
England, afterwards marry the Lady Ogle?" a question which showed beyond
all doubt that he had in some form entertained a design against Mr.
Thynne's life, and also that the attainment of the lady was the motive.
But whatever may have been the intention of the Count, and whatever may
have been the nature of his intercourse with the Lady Ogle, it is quite
clear that they were not married. On the contrary, this lady of early
nuptial experience, and of romantic but somewhat suspicious
adventure,&mdash;who was married three times, and twice a widow, before she
was sixteen years old,&mdash;was married on the 30th of May, 1682, and within
four months after the murder of Mr. Thynne, to Charles Seymour, Duke of
Somerset. (Collins's <i>Peerage</i>, vol. i. p. 191.) Thus early practised in
<i>matrimonial</i> intrigue, we find her thirty years afterwards the
accomplished organ of <i>political</i> intrigue; the favourite and friend of
Queen Anne, and the zealous partisan of the Whig party. In that
character she became the object of Swift's pasquinade, the "Windsor
Prophecy," which, though aimed at the Duchess of Somerset, and the
destruction of her influence at court, recoiled upon the head of the
author, prevented the queen from making him a bishop, and banished him
from her favour for the remainder of her reign. The meaning of the
"Prophecy," and the keenness of its sarcasm, were of course readily
understood and appreciated by cotemporaries. Swift himself seems to have
been highly pleased with it. He says, in one of his letters to Stella,
"The Prophecy is an admirable good one, and the people are mad for it."
The above recital of the early history of the Duchess of Somerset will
render it fully intelligible at the present day. After mentioning some
incidents and characters of the time, the "Windsor Prophecy" ends thus:

<h3>
<span>FOLK LORE.</span>
</h3>

<p>The pages of "N. &amp; Q." have given the most varied and valuable
contributions to the "folk lore" of Britain; your contributors have
unquestionably saved many a scrap from oblivion, illustrated many an
obscure allusion, recorded many an old custom, and generally, by the
interesting nature of their notes (throwing, as they do, the newest and
strongest light on the darkest and most out-of-the-way nooks and corners
of the house and field life, and general turn of thought of the great
mass of the people), paved the way for a higher estimate being formed by
literary men, and the general reading public, of the real worth and
present available use of this hitherto despised branch of inquiry; and
stimulating to some extended and systematic garnering-up of those
precious fragments that still exist in unguessed abundance (sown
broad-cast, as they are, from Land's End to John o'Groat's), though fast
perishing. I am confident that there is no county or district in Great
Britain that would not yield, to a careful, diligent, and qualified
seeker, a rich and valuable harvest; and where quaint memorials of the
people might not be unearthed, to be gathered together and stored up,
ready to the moulding hand of some coming Macaulay, who may there find
illustrations to make clear, and clues to guide the searcher in the
darkest and most entangled mazes of history.</p>

<p>Pardon, sir, for this most prosy and long-winded preface. I have been
induced to address you by observing what is being done in other
countries, by a desire to point out an example, and stimulate to its
emulation that able and tried body of inquirers in this country, who,
for love of the subject, have <i>already</i> collected such valuable stores.</p>

<p>In the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> of Monday, the 23rd of February, 1852 (No.
26,571. p. 6.), under the heading <i>Denmark</i>, is the following:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Two young Finnish students are wandering through the districts
   round Tammerfors, for the purpose of collecting and preserving
   old Finnish folk-tales, legends, songs, runes, riddles, and
   proverbs, &amp;c. Their names are B. Paldani and O. Palander. They
   are not assisted by the Finnish Literary Society, whose funds at
   this moment are not in a condition to bear any extra expenses,
   but by two divisions of the students at Helsingfors, namely, the
   West Finnish and the Wiborg students, each of which has
   subscribed <i>fifty</i> silver rubles for this purpose. The two
   literary pilgrims have already collected rich treasures of
   Finnish folk-lore. <i>Why do we not follow their example? When will
   some of our accomplished young scholars wander over the hills and
   dales of merry England, rescuing from oblivion our rich
   traditions, before they pass for ever from among us? Surely the
   Society of Antiquaries might arrange similar visits for a similar
   purpose. There is no want of men able and willing to undertake
   the task, only the A<span class="smcap lowercase">RRANGING</span> H<span class="smcap lowercase">AND</span> is wanting. In the meantime let
   every man do what he can in his own neighbourhood.</i>"</p>


<p>In hopes that the "<i>arranging hand</i>" may, through the medium of "N. &amp;
Q.," start out of chaos ready for its work, and the "<i>men able and
willing</i>" not be wanting, I beg to state that (being unable to aid the
cause otherwise) I will gladly contribute in the way of money, as far as
my abilities go, should any systematic plan be arranged.</p>

<h3>
<span>LONDON STREET CHARACTERS.</span>
</h3>

<p>Mr. Dickens's graphic description of the Court of Chancery, in his new
work, <i>Bleak House</i>, contains the following sketch:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Standing on a seat at the side of the hall, ... is a little mad
   old woman in a squeezed bonnet, who is always in court ...
   expecting some incomprehensible judgment to be given in her
   favour. Some say she really is, or was, a party to a suit: but no
   one knows for certain, because no one cares. She carries some
   small litter in a reticule which she calls her documents:
   principally consisting of paper matches and dry lavender."</p>


<p>There is a diminutive creature, somewhat answering to this description,
who limps on a stick and one leg that is shorter than the other, all the
early morning in the still courts of the Temple; and seems to be waiting
the result of some consultation, before she reappears, as is her wont,
in Westminster Hall. Whether this person suggested the victim of <i>Bleak
House</i>, is a question of no moment. The story commonly told of her is a
very similar one, namely, that she was ruined and crazed, like Peter
Peebles, by the slow torture of a law-suit. Is anything known of her
real history?</p>

<p>What were the fortunes and fate of a poor female lunatic, who was called
<i>Rouge et noir</i>, from her crape sables and painted cheeks; and who used
to loiter every day about the Royal Exchange at four o'clock; and seemed
to depend for subsistence upon the stray bounty of the "money-changers?"
It was said that she had a brother who was hanged for forgery, and that
this drove her mad.</p>

<p>About thirty years ago, there might be heard any morning in the smaller
streets of "the city," a cry of "dolls' bedsteads," from a lean lame
man<a id="Page_271"></a> <span class="pagenum">[271]</span> on a crutch; who wore an apron, and carried miniature
bedsteads for sale. Of this man it was generally reported, that he was
implicated in the Cato Street conspiracy, and turned king's evidence.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb describes a character, whom it is also impossible to
forget:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "A well-known figure, or part of the figure of a man, who used to
   guide his upper half over the pavements of London, wheeling along
   with most ingenious celerity upon a machine of wood.... He was of
   a robust make, with a florid sailor-like complexion, and his head
   was bare to the storm and sunshine.... The accident which brought
   him low, took place during the riots of 1780."</p>

<p>Is this all that is known of this half-giant?</p>

<p>When the old Houses of Parliament were standing, there used to be at one
of the entrances a dwarf, long past middle age, who persisted in
offering his services as a guide. His countenance was full of grave
wisdom, quite Socratic in expression; but, I believe, he was an idiot.
Does anything of interest attach to the remembrance of him?</p>

<p>And, lastly, not to "stretch the line out to the crack of doom," what
became of Billy Waters? Do these street heroes die the death of common
men&mdash;in bed, and with friends near them; or do they generally find their
fate at last in the workhouse or the gaol; and get buried no one knows
when, or by whom, or where?</p>

<p>I cannot agree with Mr. Dickens, that "no one knows for certain" about
such persons, "<i>because</i> no one cares." Indeed, Mr. D.'s philosophy and
practice are at variance in this matter. He makes his own sketch of "the
little mad old woman," because he feels that it will interest. How much
more would the original, could we get at it! But the truth is, these
people are as mysterious as the fireman's dog. They "come like shadows,
so depart:" leaving behind them on many minds ineffaceable impressions.
Indeed, some of us could confess with shame, that the feathered cocked
hat and fiddle of Billy Waters had survived the memory of a thousand
things of real importance: which could hardly be, were there not some
psychological force in these street characters&mdash;an inexplicable interest
and attraction.</p>

<span class="bla">Minor Notes.</span>
</h3>


<h4>
<span><i>Dean Swift on Herbert's Travels.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In a copy, now in my library, of
Herbert's <i>Travels in Africa, Asia, &amp;c.</i>, folio, 1634, there is a very
characteristic note in the autograph of Dean Swift, to whom the book
formerly belonged. Thinking that it may not be uninteresting to some of
the readers of "N. &amp; Q.," I send a copy of it:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  "If this book were stript of its impertinence, conceitedness, and
   tedious digressions, it would be almost worth reading, and would
   then be two-thirds smaller than it is.</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "1720. J. S<span class="smcap lowercase">WIFT</span>."</p>

  <p class="blockquot">   "The author published a new edition in his older days, with many
   additions, upon the whole more insufferable than this. He lived
   several years after the Restoration, and some friends of mine
   knew him in Ireland. He seems to have been a coxcomb both ævi
   vitio et sui."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Joe Miller.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The remains of this patriarch of puns and jokes, hitherto
peaceably resting in the burial-ground in Portugal Street, will now be
disturbed to make way for the new buildings of King's College Hospital.
Surely "Old Joe" ought not to be carted away, and <i>shot</i> as rubbish.
Some plain memorial of him might soon be raised, if an appeal were made
to the public; and if every one whose conscience told him he had ever
been indebted to Miller, would subscribe only a penny to the memorial
fund, the requisite sum would soon be collected.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Hints to Book-buyers.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Inquirers buy books on subjects which they
have, at the time, no particular intention of closely investigating:
when such intention afterwards arises, they begin to collect more
extensively. But it often happens, I suspect, that it does not come into
their heads to examine what they have already got, as to which their
memory is not good, because their acquisitions were not made under any
strong purpose of using them. The warning which suggests itself is as
follows: Always remember to examine the old library as if it were that
of a stranger, when you begin any new subject, and before you buy any
new books.</p>

<p>Here is another warning, not wholly unconnected with the former: Never
judge of a book, that is, of all which comes between the two boards, by
the title-page, which may be only the <i>first</i> title-page, in spite of
the lettering at the back. Persons who bind their books will not always
be bound themselves, either by law of congruity or convenience. I once
hunted shop and stall for a speech delivered in parliament a century
ago, not knowing that I had long possessed it bound up at the end of a
Latin summary of Leibnitzian philosophy. At the risk of posthumously
revealing my real name, I will add that I wrote on the fly-leaf that I
was not the blockhead who bound the book.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Birmingham Antiquities.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I wish to put on record in your journal a
fact concerning the antiquities of Birmingham. There is a street in this
borough, called Camden Street, which after crossing Worstone Lane,
acquires the name of Lower Camden Street. On the right-hand side of
Lower Camden Street (as you go from Camden Street), is some pasture
ground, bounded on one side by a<a id="Page_272"></a> <span class="pagenum">[272]</span> stream called Chub-brook, which
formerly flowed into the old Hockley Pool. This pasture ground shows the
evident traces of a moat, and the foundations of several walls of a
large building. I apprehend this is the spot referred to in Hutton's
<i>History of Birmingham</i>, p. 254., fourth edition:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"The lord Clinton and his lady seem to have occupied the
   Manor-house, and Sir Thomas (de Birmingham), unwilling to quit
   the place of his affections and of his nativity, erected a castle
   for himself at Worstone; where, though the building is totally
   gone, the vestiges of its liquid security are yet complete."</p>


<p>As the field will probably be built on in a short time, I wish to
identify the spot referred to by Hutton.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Buchanan and Voltaire.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Voltaire has obtained credit for a very smart
epigram, and one which the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> (vol. xxi. p. 271.) calls
"one of his happiest repartees." It was, however, stolen by him, either
designedly or unwittingly, from the celebrated Buchanan. Here are the
two versions, and the point will be observed to be the same in both:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "An Englishman visiting Voltaire in his retreat at Ferney,
   happened to mention Haller, in whose praise the philosopher
   enlarged with great warmth. The other observed that this was very
   handsome on the part of M. de Voltaire, as Haller was by no means
   so liberal to M. de Voltaire. 'Alas!' said the patriarch, 'I dare
   say we are both of us very much mistaken!'"</p>


<p>Is not this the same as Buchanan's epigram (<i>Ep.</i>, lib. 1. ed. Wets.)?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Indignities on the Bodies of Suicides.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;We are all aware of the
popular repugnance to permitting the bodies of suicides to be interred
within the "consecrated" or "hallowed" precincts of a churchyard. Burial
at cross-roads was the usual mode. In many parts of Scotland such
burials had to take place under cloud of night, to avoid the
interference of the rabble. But it would appear from the extract given
below, that public indignities were inflicted upon such corpses, to
testify public detestation of this crime. The extract is taken from the
<i>Diarey of Robert Birrel</i>, Burges of Edinburghe:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"1598, Feb. 20. The 20 day of Februar, Thomas Dobie drounit
   himself in the Quarrel holes besyde the Abbay, and upone the
   morne, he wes harlit throw the toune backward, and therafter
   hangit on the gallows."</p>


<p>Perhaps some correspondent of "N. &amp; Q." may be able to point out similar
instances of such a revolting procedure.</p>

<p>The "Abbay" referred to was the Abbey of Holyrood.</p>

<p>The "Quarrel," or Quarry holes, seem to have been fatal, in many cases,
both to "man and beast;" for Sir David Lyndsay, in one of his poems,
says:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Marry, I lent my gossip my mare, to fetch hame coals,</p>
     <p> And he <i>her drounit into the quarry holes</i>."</p>

<h2>
<span class="bla">Queries.</span>
</h2>

<h3>
<span>"GOD'S LOVE," ETC., AND OTHER POEMS.</span>
</h3>

<p>I should be very glad if, among the many learned contributors to the "N.
&amp; Q.," there should be any one who can give me information respecting a
rare volume of English poetry, of which I do not recollect to have seen
any notice, or any other copy than that in my own possession.</p>

<p>It is a 12mo., or rather small 8vo. volume, and, by the type and general
appearance, was probably printed rather before than after 1660. It
consists of three portions:</p>

<p>1. "God's Love and Man's Unworthiness," which commences thus:</p>

   <div class="poem">

<p>"G<span class="smcap lowercase">OD</span>! how that word hath thunder-clapt my soul</p>
     <p> Into a ravishment; I must condole</p>
  <p>    My forward weakness. Ah! where shall I find</p>
  <p>    Sufficient metaphors t' express my mind?</p>
<p>      Thou heart-amazing word, how hast thou fill'd</p>
   <p>   My soul with Hallelujahs, and distill'd</p>
     <p> Wonders into me!"</p>

</div>


<p>This poem is in two parts, and extends to p. 82.</p>

<p>2. "A Dialogue between the Soul and Satan," p. 83 to 124, including a
short supplementary poem entitled "The Soul's Thankfulness and Request
to God."</p>

<p>3. "Divine Ejaculations." One hundred and forty-nine in all. Each
consists of six lines. I extract the tenth as a specimen:</p>


<div class="poem">

      <p>"Great God! Thy garden is defaced:</p>
<p>      The weeds do thrive, the flowers decay:</p>
     <p> O call to mind thy promise past,</p>
    <p>  Restore thou them, cut these away.</p>
       <p> Till then, let not the weeds have power</p>
       <p> To starve or taint the poorest flower."</p>

</div>


<p>The copy now before me has no title-page or prefatory matter of any
kind, and it wants the second sheet, p. 17 to 32. Yet I do not think it
imperfect, for though the paging goes from p. 16 to p. 33, yet the
catch-word on the 16th page is answered by the first word on p. 33, and
the sense is consecutive.</p>

<p>It seems to me, therefore, that the author changed in some degree his
plan, as the work was proceeding at the press, and that the little
volume having thus the appearance of negligence and incompleteness, no
title or preface was ever printed, and the book never issued for sale.
</p>

<p>On this, or any other point, but especially on the<a id="Page_273"></a> <span class="pagenum">[273]</span> question who
was the writer of so much verse, I wish to receive information from some
of the readers of your very entertaining and often instructive
miscellany.</p>

<h3>
<span>PRAYING TO THE DEVIL.</span>
</h3>

<p>I always thought that this unfashionable sort of worship was confined to
some obscure fanatical sects in the East, and was not prepared to find
an apparent record of its having been practised, amidst the frivolities
and plotting of the French Court, by no less celebrated a lady than
Catharine de Medicis. In the <i>Secret History of France for the Last
Century</i> (London, printed for A. Bell, at the Cross Keys in Cornwel,
(<i>sic.</i>) &amp;c. 1714), I find such an odious charge advanced. I do not draw
attention to it with the slightest shadow of belief in a story so
ridiculous and incredible; but to ask, whether there existed any
foundation for the following statement regarding the "steel box," and if
so, what were its contents?</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  "In the first Civil War, when the Prince of <i>Conde</i> was in all
   appearance likely to prevail, and <i>Katherine</i> was thought to be
   very near the End of her much desir'd Regency, during the Young
   King's Minority, she was known to have been for Two days
   together, retir'd to her Closet, without admitting her menial
   Servants to her Presence. Some few Days after, having call'd for
   Monsieur <i>De Mesme</i>, one of the Long Robe, and always firm to her
   Interest, she deliver'd him a Steel Box fast lock'd, to whom she
   said, giving him the Key, <i>That in respect she knew not what
   might come to be her Fortune, amidst those intestine Broils that
   then shook</i> France, <i>she had thought fit to inclose a thing of
   great Value within that Box, which she consign'd to his Care, not
   to open it upon Oath, but by an Express Order under her own
   Hand.</i> The Queen Dying, without ever calling for the Box, it
   continued many Years unopen'd in the Family of <i>De Mesme</i>, after
   both their Deaths, till at last Curiosity, or the Suspicion of
   some Treasure from the heaviness of it, tempted Monsieur <i>De
   Mesme's</i> Successor to break it open, which he did. Instead of any
   Rich Present from so great a Queen, what Horror must the Lookers
   on have, when they found a Copper Plate of the Form and Bigness
   of one of the Ancient <i>Roman</i> Votive Shields, on which was
   Engraven <i>Queen</i> Katherine de Medicis <i>on her Knees, in a Praying
   Posture, offering up to the Devil sitting upon a Throne, in one
   of the ugliest Shapes they use to Paint him,</i> Charles the IXth.
   <i>then Reigning, the Duke of</i> Anjou, <i>afterwards</i> Henry <i>the</i>
   IIId., and <i>the Duke of</i> Alanson, <i>her Three sons, with this
   Motto in</i> French, <i>So be it, I but Reign.</i> This very Plate
   continues yet in the Custody of the House of <i>Mesme</i>, of which
   Monsieur <i>D'Avaux</i>, so famous for his Ambassies, was a Branch,
   and was not only acknowledged by him to be so, when Ambassador in
   <i>Holland</i>, but he was also pleas'd at that time, to promise a
   Great Man in <i>England</i>, a Copy of it; which is a Terrible
   Instance of the Power of Ambition in the Minds of <i>French</i>
   Princes, and to what Divinity, if one dares give the Devil that
   name, even in Irony, they are ready to pay their adoration,
   rather than part with their hopes of Empire."&mdash;Pp. 6, 7.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Meaning of the Word "Elvan."</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Will any kind philologist come to the
aid of the geologists in ascertaining the meaning of this uncouth word?
In the current number of the <i>Quarterly Journal of the Geological
Society</i> (No. 29.) we read:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Certain quartziferous porphyries which occur in the mining
   districts of Cornwall as veins, partly in granite, partly in
   clay-slate, have been long there<a id="Page_274"></a> <span class="pagenum">[274]</span> known under the name of
   'Elvans.' We have in vain sought for the origin of this term in
   English writers. Henwood expressly says (<i>Trans. Geol. Soc. of
   Cornwall</i>, vol. v.) that the etymology of the word is unknown.
   May it not perhaps be derived from a place called 'Elvan?' Reuss
   says, in his <i>Lehrbuch der Geognosie</i>, that porphyry occurs near
   Elvan in Westmoreland."</p>

<p>On turning to Borlase (<i>Natural History of Cornwall</i>, p. 91.), I find
that he gives the derivation as follows:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Quasi ab Hel-vaen, <i>i.e.</i> the stone generally found in brooks;
   unless it be a corruption of An-von, which in Cornish signifies a
   smith's anvil, and might fitly represent this very hard stone."</p>

<p>The term is a Cornish one, and applied to a crystalline rock usually
hard enough to strike fire readily on sharp friction; and may it not
have been derived from the Cornish word "<i>Elven</i>, a spark of fire,"
given in Borlase's vocabulary.</p>

<span><i>Archæologia Cambrensis, Vol I., Reprint.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;I have recently purchased a
copy of the above work to complete my set; but before doing so, I
enquired of Mr. Pickering the publisher, if it was in all respects as
well executed as the first copies. The answer, however, gave me no more
information than "that the numbers of vol. i. <i>Arch. Camb.</i>, which were
destroyed by fire, have been <i>reprinted</i>, so as to make up a few copies,
and the price is consequently 21<i>s.</i>" The "reprint" is not as well
executed as the original copies, inasmuch as nearly a whole page of
interesting matter is omitted, and very few of the reprinted pages
correspond with the good old ones. I have been a long time looking for
the first volume of the <i>Archæologia Cambrensis</i>, the greater portion of
which had been so unfortunately destroyed by fire; and though I cannot
consider the "reprint" quite as good as the old copies, still I was very
glad to obtain it. I trouble you with this "Note," not because I am
dissatisfied with the mode of execution of the reprint, but in the hope
that some of your correspondents will favour me with a few words on the
work, and inform me why the page has been omitted, and why the reprinted
pages do not agree with those of the old copies. Are there any other
faults in the "reprint" which may have escaped my notice?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Presbyterian Oath.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The author of the <i>Faggot of French Sticks</i>
remarks, that he never remained ignorant of anything which excited his
attention in the streets of Paris when any one passing by could give him
the information required: so now that there is such a living
encyclopædia to consult as "N. &amp; Q.," no knowledge should be lost for
want of inquiry. In more than one publication it has been lately
asserted, that presbyterian ministers take the following oath:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"We all subscribe, and with hands uplifted to the most High God
   do swear: 1. That we shall sincerely, really, and constantly
   through the grace of God, endeavour in our several places and
   callings to bring the church of God in the three kingdoms to the
   nearest conjunction and uniformity in religion, confession of
   faith, form of church government, &amp;c. 2. That we shall in like
   manner, without respect of persons, endeavour the extirpation of
   popery and prelacy (that is, church government by archbishops,
   bishops, deans, and others.)"</p>


<p>The Bishop of Exeter, in a recent pamphlet, inserts this parenthesis:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"(Whether this actual subscription and oath be still continued, I
   know not: but the covenant is still a part of the Kirk's
   symbolical book, and published as such for the education of the
   people)."</p>

<span>"<i>A Pinch of Snuff from Dean Swift's Box.</i>"</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Some years ago I saw in the
shop of a dealer in curiosities, in London, an old snuff-box, which was
said to have belonged to Dean Swift; it was accompanied with three
printed leaves, of the common octavo size, the first page of which
commenced<a id="Page_275"></a> <span class="pagenum">[275]</span> with "A Pinch of Snuff from Dean Swift's Snuff Box,"
(being a description of the snuff-box in question). The next subject on
the leaves began with "'Tis a hundred years since." The leaves appeared
to have been extracted from some Irish magazine or periodical, published
about the year 1845-6, and to contain much valuable and amusing matter.
As I have made repeated inquiries among the London booksellers in vain,
for the name of the publication from which the above-mentioned extract
was taken, I shall feel much obliged if you will permit me to make a
similar inquiry through the medium of "N. &amp; Q.," and by so doing you

<h4>
<span><i>Cromwell's Skull.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I believe that a skull, maintained by arguments of
considerable weight to be the veritable skull of the Protector, is now
carefully kept in the hands of some person in London. It is understood
that this interesting relic is retained in great secrecy, from the
apprehension that a threat, intimated in the reign of George III., that
if made public, it would be seized by government, as the only party to
which it could properly belong.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that the time in which such a threat could be executed
has passed by, and that no danger need now be apprehended by the
possessor for his open avowal of the facts of the case, such as they
are.</p>

<p>Indeed, it seems desirable that if fair means could lead to such a
result, the skull of one who filled so conspicuous a position amongst
England's most distinguished rulers, should become public property.</p>

<p>Perhaps some one in possession of the arguments verifying the identity
of the skull in question with that of Cromwell, would, by a
recapitulation of them, favour some readers of the "N. &amp; Q.", and
amongst others</p>

<span><i>John Lord Berkeley, Bishop of Ely.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In the Diary of Dr. Edward Lake,
published in the <i>Camden Miscellany</i>, vol. i. p. 16., occur the
following paragraphs:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Dec. 23. 1677. I administered the sacrament to the Lord John
   Barclay, being not well."</p>


<p>To the word Barclay, the editor, George Percy Elliott, Esq., has
subjoined the following note:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">   "Probably Lord John Berkeley; he was afterwards Bishop of
   Rochester, and subsequently of Ely, and was deprived for not
   taking the oath of allegiance to William and Mary."</p>

<p>Can any reader of "N. &amp; Q." suggest any authority for the statement in
the editor's note? Francis Turner was Bishop of Ely from 1684 to 1691,
when he was deprived for refusing to take the oath of allegiance to
William and Mary. Turner was succeeded by Simon Patrick, translated from
Chichester. As to the Rochester see, that was filled by Thomas Sprat
from 1684 to 1713. His biography reminds one more of the Vicar of Bray
than the sturdy Nonjuror.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Palace of Lucifer.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In Milton's elegy upon the death of Bishop
Andrewes there is an allusion to a fabled <i>Palace of Lucifer</i> which I do
not quite understand. It seems to refer to some romantic description or
other, and I shall be much obliged to any one that will kindly tell me
by whom. It is always important to know something of the train of an
author's reading, as we then can better understand the ordinary train of
his thoughts&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem">

      <p>"Serpit odoriferas per opes levis aura Favoni,</p>
       <p> Aura sub innumeris humida nata rosis,</p>
     <p> <i>Talis in extremis terræ Gangetidis oris</i></p>

    <p>  Eleg. III. <i>In obitum Præsulis Wintoniensis</i>, l. 47.</p>
/
</div>


<p>And now I will give Thomas Warton's note in full. He says:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"I know not where this fiction is to be found. But our author has
   given a glorious description of a palace of Lucifer in the
   <i>Paradise Lost</i>, b. v. 757.:</p>

   <div class="poem">

 <p>  "'At length into the limits of the North</p>
    <p>  They came, and Satan to his <i>royal seat</i></p>
     <p> High on a hill, far blazing, as a mount,</p>
     <p> Rais'd on a mount, with pyramids and towers</p>
     <p> From diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold,</p>
      <p>The <i>Palace of Great Lucifer</i>, so call</p>
     <p> That structure, in the dialect of men</p>
      <p>Interpreted; which not long after, he,</p>
    <p>  Affecting all equality with God,</p>
      <p>In imitation of that mount, whereon</p>
    <p>  Messiah was declar'd in sight of Heaven,</p>
     <p> The Mountain of the Congregation call'd,' &amp;c.</p>

</div>

   <p>"Here is a mixture of Ariosto and Isaiah. Because Lucifer is
   simply said by the prophet 'to sit upon the Mount of the
   Congregation on the sides of the North,' Milton builds him a
   palace on this mountain, equal in magnificence and brilliancy to
   the most superb and<a id="Page_276"></a> <span class="pagenum">[276]</span> romantic castle. In the text, <i>by the
   utmost parts of the Gangetic land</i>, we are to understand the
   north; the river Ganges, which separates India from Scythia,
   arising from the mountain Taurus."</p>

<h3>
<span>AGE OF TREES; TILFORD OAK.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 401., &amp;c.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I hope your correspondent L., in his search for ancient trees, will not
overlook the Great Oak at Tilford near Farnham, which is worth a visit
for its size and beauty, if not for its antiquity. Mr. Brayley, in his
<i>History of Surrey</i>, vol. v. p. 288., thus speaks of it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "In the Charter granted by Henry de Blois about the year 1250, to
   the monks of Waverley, he gives them leave to inclose their lands
   wherever they please, within these bounds, 'which extend,' says
   the record, 'from the Oak of Tilford, which is called the Kynghoc
   [a quercu de Tyleford quæ vocatur Kynghoc], by the king's highway
   towards Farnham, &amp;c.' ... The Tilford Oak is still standing, and
   is known by its ancient appellation of the King's Oak: a name
   which it could not have obtained unless it had been of
   considerable age and growth at the time of the bishop's grant;
   and it may therefore be reasonably supposed to be 800 or 900
   years old. It is a noble tree, and still flourishing apparently
   without decay."</p>


<p>I very much doubt the identity of the present tree with the "King's Oak"
of Henry de Blois. <i>First</i>, Because the present bounds of Waverley do
not run within 300 yards of the tree; and the bounds are hardly likely
to have been materially changed, inasmuch as the abbey lands are
freehold and tithe-free, whereas the surrounding lands are copyhold and
titheable. <i>Secondly</i>, because the tree itself appears still to be
growing and vigorous. Cobbett describes it in his <i>Rural Rides</i>, p. 15.,
1822, with his usual accuracy of observation:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Our direct road was right over the heath, through Tilford, to
   Farnham: but we veered a little to the left after we came to
   Tilford, at which place, on the green, we stopped to look at an
   <i>oak tree</i>, which, when I was a little boy, was but a very little
   tree, comparatively, and which is now, taken altogether, by far
   the finest tree that I ever saw in my life. The stem or shaft is
   short, that is to say, it is short before you come to the first
   limbs; but it is full thirty feet round at about eight or ten
   feet from the ground. Out of the stem there come not less than
   fifteen or sixteen limbs, many of which are from five to six feet
   round, and each of which would in fact be considered a decent
   stick of timber. I am not judge enough of timber to say anything
   about the quantity in the whole tree; but my son stepped the
   ground, and, as nearly as we could judge, the diameter of the
   extent of the branches was upwards of ninety feet, which would
   make a circumference of about 300 feet. The tree is in full
   growth at the moment. There is a little hole in one of the limbs,
   but with that exception, not the smallest sign of decay<a id="Page_278"></a> <span class="pagenum">[278]</span>
   The tree has made great shoots in all parts of it this last
   summer, and there are no appearances of <i>white</i> on the trunks
   such as are regarded as the symptoms of full growth. There are
   many sorts of oak in England: two very distinct. One with a pale
   leaf, and one with a dark leaf; this is of the pale leaf."</p>

<p>Any other references to the age or history of this tree would oblige.</p>

xvii.</p>

<p class="right">  O<span class="smcap lowercase">XONIENSIS</span>.</p>

 <p class="left">  Broad Street, Oxford.</p>

<p>Your correspondent M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. G<span class="smcap lowercase">ILL</span> (Vol. v., p. 175.) suggests an inquiry as to
the probable extent to which St. Paul was acquainted with the writings
of Aristotle. His letter reminds me of a similar question of still
greater interest, which has often occurred to me, and to which I should
like to call your readers' attention, "Whether St. Paul had read Plato?"
I think no one who studies the 15th of the First Epistle to the
Corinthians&mdash;that sublime chapter in which the Apostle sets forth the
doctrine of the Resurrection&mdash;and who is also familiar with the <i>Phædo</i>,
can fail to be struck with a remarkable similarity in one portion of the
argument. I allude especially to the 36th verse of the chapter, and
those immediately following, "That which thou sowest is not quickened
except it die," &amp;c. The reasoning, as almost every Christian knows, is
based on analogy, and tends to show that, as in the vegetable world life
springs from death, the seed dies, but out of it comes the perfect
plant; so the dissolution of our present body is only a necessary step
to the more glorified and complete development of our nature. In the
<i>Phædo</i>, sect. 16., Socrates is represented as employing the same
argument in defence of his doctrine of the immortality of the soul. In
the course of his discussion with Kebes and Simmius on this subject, a
consideration of the phenomena of animal and vegetable life leads him to
assert the general conclusion, "<span title="[Greek: ek tôn tethneôtôn, ta zônta te
kai hoi zôntes gignontai]">&#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#949;&#952;&#957;&#949;&#8061;&#964;&#969;&#957;, &#964;&#8048; &#950;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#8049; &#964;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#7985;

probability that in like manner the soul will not only survive the body,
but reach a higher and purer condition after its death. Wetstein, whose
abundant classical illustrations of the sacred text are alluded to by
your correspondent, refers to little else than verbal parallelisms in
his notes on this chapter, and does not quote Plato at all; nor do I
remember seeing any edition of the Greek Testament in which the
coincidence is pointed out. Perhaps some of your correspondents can
elucidate this subject; it is one of great interest, and when pursued in
the reverent and religious spirit indicated by MR. GILL, can hardly fail
to prove a source of profitable investigation.</p>

<h3>
<span>SIR ALEXANDER CUMMING.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 257.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I have in my possession a manuscript consisting of copies of various
letters, and other memorials of Sir Alexander Cumming. It is of his own
period, but whether of his own handwriting I cannot say.</p>

<p>They are clearly the compositions of a person of an unsettled intellect;
but we may collect from them the following facts:&mdash;His captain's
commission was dated May 29, 1703; he was called by his mother, a few
days before her death, both Jacob and Israel. This is further explained
when he relates that Lady Cumming, his mother, set out from Edinburgh
the first of the "Borrowing Days," towards the end of March, 1709.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "The three last days of March are called 'the Borrowing Days' in
   Scotland, on account of their being generally attended with very
   blustering weather, which<a id="Page_279"></a> <span class="pagenum">[279]</span> inclines people to say that they
   would wish to <i>borrow</i> three days from the month of April, in
   exchange for those three last days of the month of March. This
   lady was seventeen days in her journeys upon the road, and lived
   ten days after her arrival in London. She died on the Monday
   se'nnight in the morning after she came to London. On the
   Thursday before her death she called her son, Captain Cumming, to
   her bed-side, and gave him her blessing in the terms of the
   prophet Isaiah, to which she referred him, and gave him her own
   new Bible to read over on the occasion, and to keep for her sake.
   But this Bible was lost, with other baggage, taken by the French
   towards the end of the campaign, 1709. Colonel Swinton, this
   lady's eldest brother, was shot at the battle of Malplaquet, and
   died upon the field of battle."</p>

<p>The lady travelled attended by her daughter Helen Cumming, and her
servant Margaret Rae.</p>

<p>But I see we have been wrong in writing the name Cumming with two <i>m</i>'s.
He writes it invariably <i>Cuming</i>. This would appear of little moment,
but the change a little diminishes the probability of the writer's
favourite notion, that the Hebrew word <i>Cumi</i> is in some way obumbrated
in his patronymic <i>Cuming</i>.</p>

<p>The passage of the prophet Isaiah which formed the substance of his
mother's last benediction is chap. xli. verses 8 and 9, and chap. xliii.
verses 2 and 3: "Thou <i>Israel</i> art my servant, <i>Jacob</i> whom I have
chosen, the seed of Abraham, my friend," &amp;c. He inclines to think that
"the writer of the book called Isaiah was a friend to the British
nation, and that the islands of Great Britain and Ireland are those
addressed to, in order to renew their strength."</p>

<p>It was on April 23, 1730, O.S., that "by the unanimous consent of the
people he was made law-giver, commander, leader, and chief of the
Cherokee nation, and witness of the power of God, at a general meeting
at Nequisee, in the Cherokee Mountains." He brought with him to England
six Cherokee chiefs, and on June 18, in that year, he was allowed to
present them to the King in the Royal Chapel at Windsor. This was at the
time of the installation of the Duke of Cumberland and the Earls of
Chesterfield and Burlington. On June 22nd was the ceremony of laying his
crown at the feet of the King, when the Indian chiefs laid also their
four scalps and five eagles' tails.</p>

<p>In a few years the scene was changed, and in 1737 we find him confined
within the limits of the Fleet Prison; but having a rule of court, on
the 8th of November he was at Knightsbridge, where about ten in the
morning he opened the Bible for an answer to his prayers, and chanced
upon the fifty-first and fifty-second chapters of Isaiah. He feels a
call to a mission to the Jews, and contemplates visiting Poland. With
that disposition of a mind disordered as his was, to turn everything
towards a particular object, he thinks there was some mysterious
connexion between the fact that Queen Caroline was seized with the
illness which proved fatal, in her library, at ten o'clock on the
morning of the 9th of November, the day after his call.</p>

<p>In 1750 he was still in the Fleet Prison, from whence, on May 15, he
addressed a letter to Lord Halifax, asserting his right to the Cherokee
Mountains, and proposing a scheme for the discharge of eighty millions
of the National Debt; the scheme being, that 300,000 families of Jews
should be settled in that country for the improvement of the lands, as
industrious honest subjects. This letter notices also two facts in the
Cuming history: 1. That Sir Alexander's father had been the means of
saving the life of King George the Second; and 2. That he, Sir
Alexander, had been taken into the secret service of the crown, at
Christmas, 1718, at a salary of 300<i>l.</i> a-year, which was discontinued
at Christmas, 1721.</p>

<h3>
<span>GENERAL WOLFE.<br />
(Vols. iv. and v., <i>passim.</i>)</span>
</h3>

<p>As everything connected with General Wolfe is entitled to notice, the
following names and public positions of his direct or collateral
ancestors may not be uninteresting to your readers. I lately furnished
you, from Ferrar's <i>History of Limerick</i>, a statement of the
circumstances under which his great-grandfather, Captain George Woulfe,
sought refuge in Yorkshire (I believe) from the proscription of Ireton,
after the capitulation, in 1651, of Limerick, when his brother Francis,
the superior of the Franciscan friars, not having been equally fortunate
in escaping, was executed, with several others, excepted from the
general pardon.</p>

<p>The family, of English origin, like the Roches, the Arthurs, Stackpoles,
Sextons, Creaghes, Whites, &amp;c., settled in Limerick between the
thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, and gradually obtained high civil
positions, when their successful commercial pursuits enabled them to
acquire landed property in the adjoining county of Clare, where nearly
all the above-named English families equally became extensive
proprietors. In</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> 1470. Garret Woulfe was one of the city bailiffs, as those
   subsequently called sheriffs were then named.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">1476. Thomas Woulfe filled the same office, as did in</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  1520. His son and namesake.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  1562. Nicholas Woulfe was bailiff.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> 1567. John Woulfe ditto.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> 1578. The same became mayor.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> 1585.&nbsp;&nbsp;} Patrick Woulfe was bailiff these two years,</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> 1587.&nbsp;&nbsp;} but not in the intervening 1586.<a id="Page_280"></a> <span class="pagenum">[280]</span></p>

  <p class="blockquot"> 1590. Thomas Woulfe&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  1591. Richard Woulfe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} were successively bailiffs,</p>

  <p class="blockquot">1592. David Woulfe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} as in</p>

  <p class="blockquot">1605. Was James Woulfe.</p>

<p>From this date till 1613 scarcely a year passed without the dismissal of
the chosen Catholic magistrates, and substitution by royal mandate of
Protestants. In 1613 George Woulfe, grandfather<a id="ther7"></a><a title="Go to footnote 7." href="#fn7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of the proscribed
Captain of the same name as above, then sheriff (the title assumed since
1609), with his colleagues, John Arthur, and the mayor, David Creagh,
was deposed for refusing the oaths of supremacy, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn7"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#ther7" class="label">[7]</a> So I was assured, many years ago, by the late Lord Chief
Baron Wolfe, from whom I also learned that all these magistrates
certainly sprung from the same stem, though how they should be
respectively placed as to constitute a form of genealogy, I cannot now
exactly indicate.</p>

<p>In 1647 Patrick Woulfe was sheriff; but from 1654, when the city
surrendered to Ireton, until June 1656, Limerick was ruled by twelve
English aldermen. In 1656 Colonel Henry Ingolsby became mayor, and the
regular order of magistracy was subsequently pursued.</p>

<p>I cannot at present trace the genealogy in strict deduction, although I
believe it all might be collected from the subsisting papers of the
family in the county of Clare; at least from Garret, the first-named
bailiff in the preceding list. In my boyhood I saw some pedigree of it
in the hands of an antiquary named Stokes, but which it would now be
difficult to discover. If the present Sir Frederick A. G. Ouseley,
Bart., son of my old schoolfellow, the late Sir George, be in possession
of the papers of his grandfather, Captain Ralph Ouseley, I think it
likely that some documents relating to General Wolfe's family, in its
ancient line, will be found, as I recollect hearing Captain Ouseley, a
resident of Limerick, speak of them.</p>

<p>&mdash;C<span class="smcap lowercase">RANMORE'S</span>
inquiry has not been fully answered, nor am I able to point out the
precise degree of relationship between John Paget and the editor of his
works, Thomas Paget. The latter became incumbent of Blackley, near
Manchester, about the year 1605, having been placed in that chapelry
chiefly through the efforts of the Rev. William Bourne, B.D., a native
of Staffordshire, who had married a kinswoman of Lord Burleigh, and who
was for many years an influential Fellow of the Collegiate Church of
Manchester. (See Hollingworth's <i>Mancuniensis</i>, pp. 106, 107.) In 1617
Thomas Paget was cited before Morton, Bishop of Chester, for
nonconformity; and shortly afterwards he was convened before Bishop
Bridgeman on the same ground. He is styled at this time "the good old
man" (Brook's <i>Lives</i>, vol. ii. p. 293.), although he lived at least
forty years afterwards. In the delightful <i>Autobiography of Henry
Newcome, M.A.</i>, the Presbyterian Minister of Manchester, edited for the
Chetham Society by the Rev. Canon Parkinson, D.D. (2 vols. 4to. 1852),
are several interesting notices of Mr. Thomas Paget. He is mentioned as
"old Mr. Pagit, late of Blakeley," in 1658, and seems to have had the
rectory of Stockport in 1659, although Richard Baxter spoke of him in
1656 as "old and sickly," and then living at Shrewsbury. He was well
known, says the amiable Newcome, "as a man of much frowardness," and
able to create "much unquietness;" but Baxter hoped, "not altogether so
morose as some report him."</p>

<p>&mdash;I have just

send it for the information of your correspondents. I copied it from an
old scrap-book:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"<i>The Scotch Thistle.</i>&mdash;The origin of the national badge is thus
   handed down by tradition:&mdash;When the Danes invaded Scotland it was
   deemed unwarlike to attack an enemy in the darkness of night,
   instead of a pitched battle by day: but, on one occasion the
   invaders resolved to avail themselves of stratagem; and in order
   to prevent their tramp from being heard, they marched barefooted.
   They had thus neared the Scottish force unobserved, when a Dane
   unluckily stepped with his foot upon a superbly prickled thistle,
   and uttered a cry of pain, which discovered the assailants to the
   Scots, who ran to their arms, and defeated the foe with great
   slaughter. The thistle was immediately adopted as the insignia of
   Scotland."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Bull the Barrel</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 200.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The practice of "bulling the
barrel" or "cask," as mentioned by C. F<span class="smcap lowercase">ORBES</span>, is an every-day occurrence
in the Navy. As soon as a rum cask is emptied, a few gallons of water
are put into the cask (and it is struck down again into the
spirit-room); this is done to keep the wood moist, and prevent it from
shrinking, so as to keep the cask water-tight: this is called "bulling
the cask;" and from the water receiving after some time a strong
impregnation, which makes it really strong grog, salt water is used,
though even the "salt-water bull," as it is called, when again poured
out, has often proved too attractive for seamen to resist. Again, it is
common to talk in the same way of "bulling a tea-pot," coffee-pot, &amp;c.;
that is, after the first "brew" has been exhausted, by adding fresh
water, and boiling over again, to make a "<i>second brew</i>" from the old
materials. This probably was derived from "bulling the cask;" but
whether the "bulling" originally applied to the preserving the
water-tight qualities of the cask, or to the making the "second brew," I
cannot pretend to say, though I should define the present acceptation of
the term "bulling" to be "the obtaining an impregnation from that which
had been already used."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Welsh Names "Blaen"</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 128.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Although my acquaintance with
the language of the Cymri is very limited, I think that a knowledge of
the cognate Erse or Gaelic enables me to make a shrewd guess at the
meaning of the word <i>Blaen</i>, prefixed to the names of so many farms in
Wales. The Gaelic word <i>Baile</i>, pronounced <i>Ballé</i>, signifies a
town&mdash;the Scotch <i>toun</i>&mdash;or farm, and, with the preposition <i>an</i> or
<i>na</i>&mdash;Anglicè <i>of</i>&mdash;is written <i>Baile'n</i>, pronounced <i>Ballen</i>: this, I
think, is probably the same word as <i>Blaen</i>, and means, being
interpreted, "the farm of." In the examples given by your correspondent
<span title="[Greek: a]">&#945;</span>, the words affixed to <i>Blaen</i> are descriptive; many of them
scarcely differ in sound from their Gaelic synonyms <i>e.g.</i> <i>Blaen-awen</i>
is the Gaelic <i>Baile'n abhuinn</i>, pronounced <i>Ballen avine</i>, Ang. "the
farm on, or of the river;" <i>Blaen-argy</i>&mdash;Gaelic, <i>Baile'n airgiod</i>, "the
silver farm," or perhaps <i>'n arguin</i>, of strife; <i>Blaen-angell</i>&mdash;Gaelic,
<i>Baile'n aingeal</i>, "angel farm"; <i>Blaen-y-foss</i>&mdash;Gaelic,
<i>Baile-na-fois</i>, pronounced <i>f[=o]sh</i>, and synonymous with the Dutch
<i>lust</i>, "leisure or pleasure farm;" and <i>Blaen-nefern</i>&mdash;Gaelic,
<i>Baile-na-fearn</i>, "alder farm." In England these farms or towns would
have been called respectively, <i>Riverton</i>, <i>Silverton</i>, <i>Alderston</i>, and
so on. The same word, generally spelt <i>Bally</i>, forms part of the name of
a very large proportion of the small towns and farms in Ireland.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>The Verb "to commit"</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 125.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The verb <i>to commit</i>, in the
sense used by Junius, was employed by Lord Chesterfield so far back as
the year 1757. In a letter to his son (Nov. 26), his lordship, after
instructing Mr. Stanhope what to say to one of the foreign ministers,
directs him to send to his own court an account of what he had done:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"Tell them you thought the measure of such great importance that
   you could not help taking this little step towards bringing it
   about, but that you mentioned it only from yourself, and that you
   have not <i>committed</i> them by it."</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield's <i>Letters to his Son</i> were not published until 1774,
which will account for Walker ascribing to Junius the merit of
introducing into the English language the French signification of the
verb <i>to commit</i>.</p>

<span><i>Beócera-gent</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 201.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;As I asked a question relating to
the Irish, perhaps I may be allowed the so-called Irish mode of
answering it myself.</p>

<p><i>Beócherie</i> is evidently derived from <i>Beóceraige</i>, the islet of
bee-hives, or bee-keepers (who were regularly appointed officers in
Saxon England); but as I was utterly at a loss for the word <i>gent</i>, I
requested the opinion of Dr. Lèo, from whom I have received the
following satisfactory reply:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"The word <i>gent</i> seems to be the same word as our German <i>gante</i>,
   and the Scottish <i>gauntree</i>; i.e. a <i>tree</i> which forms a stand
   for barrels, hives, &amp;c. In several parts of Germany, where the
   culture of bees has, from distant periods, been carried on
   extensively, the hives are transported from one place to another
   according to the seasons: now in the forests, when the pine-trees
   are in flower; now in the fields, when the rape blossoms; then
   again in the woods, when the heather blossoms; and at last, when
   winter approaches, in the barn. A tree forms the stand for the
   bee-hive, and thatch protects it from the rain. Such a tree seems
   to be the <i>beócera-gent</i>.</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "In an old Glossary, the old high-German word, <i>gantmari</i>, is
   interpreted as <i>tignarius</i> (i.e. <i>faber tignarius</i>, a carpenter).
   This word presupposes another word <i>gant</i>, a beam or a rafter,
   probably equivalent to your Ang.-Sax. <i>gent</i>; and thus
   <i>beócera-gent</i> would be a beam upon which to stand bee-hives."</p>

<p>The question still remains, Why was the islet in question called Parva
Hibernia?</p>

<p>&mdash;To E. D.'s Query, "whether
there is any well-authenticated instance of a woman having had more than
twenty-five children?" something like a reply will be found in the
following paragraph, which formed one of a series of "Curious Extracts,"
in the <i>Edinburgh Antiquarian Magazine</i> (1848):&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "'<i>Extraordinary Number of Children.</i>&mdash;The following
   extraordinary, yet well-attested fact, is copied from Brand's
   <i>History of Newcastle</i>, lately published. The fact is mentioned
   and corroborated by a quotation from an Harleian MS. No. 980-87.
   A weaver in Scotland had, by one wife, a Scotch woman,
   <i>sixty-two</i> children, all living till they were baptized; of whom
   four<a id="Page_283"></a> <span class="pagenum">[283]</span> daughters only lived to be women, but forty-six sons
   attained to man's estate. In 1630, Joseph Delavel, Esq., of
   Northumberland, rode thirty miles beyond Edinburgh, to be
   satisfied of the truth of this account, when he found the man and
   woman both living; but at that time had no children abiding with
   them. Sir John Bowes and three other gentlemen having, at
   different periods, taken each ten in order to bring them up; the
   rest also being disposed of. Three or four of them were at that
   period (1630) at Newcastle.'&mdash;<i>European Magazine</i>, Dec. 1786."</p>

<p>&mdash;One of the handsomest
quartos of our day, both in typography and engravings, is, <i>Two Systems
of Astronomy: first, the Newtonian System ... second, the System in
accordance with the Holy Scriptures</i> ... by Isaac Frost, London, 4to.,
1846 (Simpkin and Marshall). This work is Muggletonian, and contains

<p>&mdash;In reply to A<span class="smcap lowercase">BERDONIENSIS</span>,
I beg to inform him that the "Maitland Club" (<i>Glasgow</i>) circulated as

volume, entitled <i>Registrum Monasterii de Passelet</i>,
 <span class="smaller">M.C.LXIII-M.D.XXIX.</span>
to which there was prefixed an highly interesting prefatory notice and
illustrative notes, in which it is there stated&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"That it may be proper to correct a popular mistake regarding
   <i>another</i> record connected with the Monastery of Paisley. <i>The
   Black Book of Paisley</i>, quoted by Buchanan and our earlier
   historians, and which (having disappeared) was raised by later

   chronicle, was nothing more than a copy of Fordun
   (<i>Scotichronicon</i>), with Bowers' Continuation. It appears to have
   been acquired by Thomas Lord Fairfax, but when Gale and Hearne
   wrote, had already been deposited in the Royal Library, where it
   is still preserved. (13. E. X.) Hearne particularly notices the

<span><i>Elegy on Coleman</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 137.).</span>

<p>&mdash;The Elegy on Coleman I have seen
paraphrased or travestied, and thus attributed to Dryden, who, not being
able to pay his wine-merchant's bill, was told, on dining with this
creditor, in the exhilaration of his cups, that if he (Dryden) would
<i>improvise</i> four lines expressive of pleasure to God, to the Devil, to
the World, and to the Merchant, the debt would be forgiven. Instantly,
therefore, the poet extemporised the following verses, sufficiently
redolent of their inspiring source:</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p>"God is pleased when we abstain from sin;</p>
  <p>    The devil is pleas'd when we remain therein;</p>

<span><i>Liber Conformitatum, &amp;c.</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 202.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;On the <i>Liber
Conformitatum</i>, I confidently assert, from accurate inquiry, that no
edition preceded that of 1510, nor is there any authority for the
alleged one of Venice. A long account of this most disedifying volume
will be found in DeBure's <i>Bibliographie Instructive</i>, No. 4540. I am in
possession of the second edition in 1511, perfectly identical in the
text. Its absurdity is equal to its obvious, though not intended,
blasphemy; for it is written in genuine simplicity of design. I have
likewise the <i>Alcorand des Cordeliers</i>, with the second book by Conrad
Badius, the son of Jodocus Badius Ascencius, a native of Belgium, but
one of the early Parisian printers, and author himself of various works.
The title of my edition of the <i>Alcoran</i>, printed at Geneva, 1575,
differs from that of 1586,<a id="Page_284"></a> <span class="pagenum">[284]</span> but necessarily of the same import,
and quite as prolix.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Grimesdyke; Grimes Graves</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 231.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;As J. F. F. has
repeated Blomefield's account of these curious pits (commonly known as
<i>Grimes Graves</i>, in Weeting parish, Norfolk), it is right to add some
more recent information respecting them. An investigation was made there
last month, by digging a trench through the middle of a pit, and at the
depth of about three feet an oval fire-place of flints was discovered,
containing numerous bones of oxen, &amp;c. One of the smaller pits was then
similarly treated, and we found the same proofs of habitation. No stone
implements were discovered, but further researches may bring some to
light. Blomefield's statement that it is a Danish camp is quite without
foundation, and his "form of a quincunx," in which he supposed the pits
to be, could have existed only in his own imagination, stimulated by the
learned labours of Sir Thomas Browne. There can be no doubt now that
they were dwellings of the British, similar to the pits on the coast at
Weybourne. That <i>Grime</i> was a Danish leader, "Præpositus," &amp;c., is also
open to doubt. When so many British earthworks are designated by this
name, what is more likely than that the Saxons, not knowing whose hands
had erected them, superstitiously ascribed them to the <i>grim</i> spirit,
the Devil?&mdash;whence <i>Grimsdyke</i>, the Devil's ditch, &amp;c. Neither this
opinion, however, nor Mr. Guest's (a "boundary") seems applicable to a
Hundred, as <i>Grimeshoo</i>, unless as being so full of Grime's operations.</p>

<p>&mdash;I confess
that I could draw quite a different conclusion from that of
C<span class="smcap lowercase">AROLUS</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">URSITOR</span> respecting Junius's single misspelt mention of Lord Lyttleton's
name. If, as the reviewer argues (supposing I remember the article
correctly), the Hon. Thomas Lyttleton only once mentioned his father, in
order to prevent public attention settling on himself as the author of
<i>Junius's Letters</i>, it seems to me to be in unison with such artifice,
that he should have purposely made a slight error in spelling the name.
But is the writer, and not the printer, responsible for this blunder?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Ink</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 151.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;A learned Cambridge professor, who has been a
V.P.R.S., once related to me the following anecdote, in reference to the
celebrated and most practical philosopher, the late Dr. Wollaston. In
the rooms of the Royal Society the Doctor chanced to mention that he
could not, for the life of him, discover the composition of the rich
black pigment used by the ancient Egyptians in their inscriptions on the
mummy cases. He had analysed it over and over again, and invariably
found animal matter present. How was this? "Why," observed a member, to
the grievous annoyance of the somewhat self-opinioned Doctor, "they used
the ink of the (<i>Sepia officinalis</i>) cuttle-fish." This most remarkable
excretion is of the deepest black hue; and that it retains its peculiar
qualities unimpaired, even after being buried beneath the chalk
formation of this earth of our's for unnumbered periods, is proved in
the case of the well-known fossil ink of Dean Buckland. I know not
whether or no this will answer the Query of MR. W. SPARROW SIMPSON, B.A.</p>

of Morocco that has probably appeared is given in the volume of the

at a moderate price by Longuet, 8. Rue de la Paix, Paris. The date on my
copy is 1850; it forms one of a series of maps issued by the same
parties, and forming an Atlas of Algeria. I add from the <i>Leipzig
Catalogue</i> (1849, viertes Heft) the title of a work which may assist
A<span class="smcap lowercase">JAX</span> in his labours. Though I have not examined the work myself, I know
it to be of some repute. The author now forms one of the mission for
exploring Central Africa:</p>

<p>&mdash;To this list may be added that of a learned lady, namely, of the
Lady Ann Bacon (Cooke), second wife of the Lord Keeper, and mother of
the Lord Chancellor. She translated, from the Italian of Bernardine
Achine, <i>Twenty-five Sermons</i>, published about 1550.</p>

<p>Sir Nathaniel Bacon, the painter, was the youngest son of Nicholas, the
eldest son of the Lord Keeper, and consequently the latter's grandson.
This Nicholas, of Redgrave, Suffolk, was High Sheriff of Norfolk, 1597,
and represented the same county in the parliament of 1603. He was the
first person created a baronet; and from him are descended the Bacons of
Redgrave, Suffolk, afterwards of Great Ryburgh, Garboldisham,
Gillingham, and now of Raveningham, Norfolk, premier baronets of
England.</p>

<p>&mdash;In reference
to the superstitious practices in question, the readers of the <i>Prose
Edda</i>, many of whose traditions still survive amongst us, will remember
what it is therein narrated concerning the ship Naglfar. Amongst the
terror-fraught prodigies preceding Ragnarök, or the Twilight of the
Gods, and the Conflagration of the Universe, we are informed that "on
the waters floats the ship Naglfar, which is constructed of the nails of
dead men. For which reason," it is said, "great care should be taken to
die with pared nails; for he who dies with his nails unpared, supplies
materials for the building of this vessel, which both gods and men wish
may be finished as late as possible." Of this ship, the more ancient and
poetical Völn-spà also speaks in something like the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"A keel from distant East is nearing,</p>
        <p>Pilotted by Loki's hand,</p>
    <p>  Muspellheimr's children bearing,&mdash;</p>
        <p>Sea-borne comes that horrid band!</p>
   <p>   With the wolf to join, are speeding,</p>
       <p> In a grim and gaunt array,</p>

<p>It is hardly worth while to mention the larger tribe of contractions,
such as Alsford for Alresford, Wilsden for Willesden, Harfordwest for
Haverfordwest; nor the class of derivations from the Roman Castrum, as
Uxeter for Uttoxeter, Toster for Towcester, and the like.</p>

<p>The railroads are correcting these grosser errors wherever they fall in
with them. I remember a few years ago, being at Gloster, and intending
to take the train to <i>Cisiter</i>, as I had always called it. "Oh!" said
the porter, with quite the air of a <i>Lingo</i>, "you mean <i>Ci-ren-cester</i>."
But I believe the good folks of the neighbourhood still stick to
<i>Aberga'ny</i> and <i>Cisiter</i>.</p>

<p>P. M. M.'s appeal to your Scotch and Irish correspondents will I think
produce little. In Scotland, names are generally pronounced as written,
with a few exceptions, such as <i>Enbro'</i> and <i>Lithgow</i>, and perhaps a few
others: but in Ireland I do not remember a single instance of the
corruption of a name; though certainly the Irish might be forgiven if
they had contracted or mollified such names as <i>Drumcullagher</i>,
<i>Ballaghaddireen</i>, <i>Moatagreenoque</i>, and <i>Tamnaughtfinlaggan</i>. The
English are, I believe, the only people who habitually <i>clip</i> proper
names of persons or places, but I think it is also the only language in
which the spelling of words does not afford a general guide for their
pronunciation. No other language that I know anything of can afford such
anomalies as are to be found, for instance, in <i>rough</i>, <i>cough</i>,
<i>lough</i>, <i>plough</i>, <i>dough</i>, <i>through</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<span><i>"There's ne'er a villain," &amp;c.</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 242.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In support of A.
E. B., with whose view I entirely concur, it may be added that <i>villain</i>
and <i>knave</i> do not make the proposition such a truism as Horatio (who is
not intended for a conjuror, much less a verbal critic) admits it to be.
Alexander the Great has been called a <i>villain</i> and a <i>robber</i>, but
never a <i>knave</i> or a <i>thief</i>. By the Rule of Three, villain: robber::
knave: thief. As a truism, intended by Hamlet before the first line was
spoken, it is not good enough for Hamlet's wit. But, supposing the
second line invented, <i>pro re natâ</i>, to cover the retreat of the
disclosure which was advancing in the first line, it is just what might
have suggested itself&mdash;for Hamlet's uncle was both villain and knave.</p>

<h3>
<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</span>
</h3>

<p>Those who judge of a book's importance by its size will be most
egregiously taken in by <i>Regal Rome: an Introduction to Roman History by
Francis W. Newman, Professor of Latin in University College, London</i>. In
this small volume of less than two hundred pages the<a id="Page_286"></a> <span class="pagenum">[286]</span> learned
professor&mdash;who holds that <i>wisely to disbelieve</i> is our first grand
requisite in dealing with materials of mixed worth&mdash;has followed, but
not slavishly, the direction which Niebuhr's erudition and untiring
energy have so appropriated, that by many it has been supposed to be
exclusively Niebuhr's own; and the result is, that he has reconstructed
a picture of ancient Rome, to which we refer our classical readers, in
the full confidence that they will thank us for doing so; and that, if
they do not, on perusal, agree with all Mr. Newman's views, they will at
least concede to him the credit due to great learning and perspicuity.</p>

<p>When we consider the great influence which the Crusades exercised on the
civilisation of Europe&mdash;how prominent is the position they occupy in the
social and political history of their era&mdash;and how fertile a source of
wealth they have proved to the poets and novelists of all succeeding
ages, and of all countries&mdash;it is certainly a matter of surprise that
amid the rage for translation which has of late years manifested itself
among us, no one should have undertaken to lay before the English reader
a translation of Michaud's able and interesting narrative of this great
chapter in the history of the Middle Ages. Michaud's work acquired for
its author, and very deservedly, an European reputation; and in issuing
a well-executed version of it at a moderate price, the publisher of
<i>Michaud's History of the Crusades, Translated from the French</i> by W.
Robson, is rendering good service, not only to those who cannot peruse
the work in the original, but to all classes of historical readers. This
(the first volume) has prefixed to it a very interesting memoir of
Michaud.</p>

<p>B<span class="smcap lowercase">OOKS</span> R<span class="smcap lowercase">ECEIVED</span>.&mdash;Mr. Bohn's contributions to the cheap publications of
the month are&mdash;in his <i>Scientific Library</i>, the fourth volume of
<i>Humboldt's Cosmos</i>, translated by Otté and Paul; in his <i>Standard
Library, The Principal Works and Remains of the Rev. Andrew Fuller, with
a new Memoir of his Life, by his Son the Rev. A. G. Fuller</i>, which
contains his <i>Gospel its own Witness, or the Holy Nature and Divine
Harmony of the Christian Religion contrasted with the Immorality and
Absurdity of Deism</i>; and his <i>Calvinistic and Socinian Systems examined
and compared as to their moral tendency</i>&mdash;two works by which this
excellent Nonconformist divine did much to stem the torrent of
immorality and infidelity which the deistical and democratical writers
of his time were infusing into the minds of the people. <i>Cicero's
Orations</i>, Vol. ii., literally translated by C. D. Yonge, is the new
volume of the <i>Classical Library</i>; that of the <i>Illustrated Library</i>
being the second and concluding volume of Allan's <i>Battles of the
British Navy</i>, illustrated with eighteen portraits of our most eminent
naval worthies. The proprietors of the <i>National Illustrated Library</i>
have completed their edition of Huc's most interesting <i>Travels in
Tartary</i> by the publication of the second volume, and have issued a new
edition in two volumes of Dr. Mackay's <i>Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular
Delusions</i>. The favour with which the original edition of this work,
written in a pleasant gossiping style, was so generally received, will
probably be increased towards the present one, as it has the advantage
of numerous woodcut illustrations, many of them highly interesting, and
all adding to the amusing character of the book.</p>

<p>At the meeting various resolutions were adopted by which the Directors
(under certain necessary provisions) were empowered, on application, to
make arrangements by which the great body of the members will be
secured, after a fixed period, from any charge for additional Premiums,
in the event of their going beyond the limits of Europe, or entering
into military or naval service; and generally to exempt their Policies
from any ground of forfeiture whatever, excepting fraud or intentional
falsehood. The effect of these alterations must be to enhance greatly
the value of the Policies as marketable securities; and the Directors
feel satisfied that they secure the Institution against any appreciable
risk, by providing that the exemption shall not in any case take effect
until after the lapse of five years from the date of the policy.</p>
